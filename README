This implementation requires a mostly C++17 compliant compiler and has been
tested with:
	* g++ 13
	* clang 18

CMake & binaries are setup for unit testing. Define NDEBUG during Release-type
builds to disable many asserts.

To use sh::not_null requires:
	* sh/pointer.hpp
	* sh/not_null.hpp

To use sh::never_null requires:
	* sh/pointer.hpp
	* sh/never_null.hpp


I hope this is useful or at least interesting!
